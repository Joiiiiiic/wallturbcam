  #   content: "My name is Noe Faure and I am a 2nd-year PhD student. I am looking at turbulent channel flow over anisotropic permeable substrates using Direct Numerical Simulations. Textures with a preferential permeability are well suited for drag reduction because they impede the streamwise flow less than the spanwise flow, which sets the virtual origin for turbulence. Following preliminary research in our group, I am investigating the interaction of the relevant mechanisms for drag-reduction (slip lengths, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, texture-coherent stresses) by conducting fully-resolved numerical simulations. These insights will help us design novel coatings with expected drag-reduction twice as big (around 20%) as the state-of-the-art riblet. My first year has been focused on improving our in-house DNS solver by using higher-order finite differences for the advective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations."
