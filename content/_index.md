The changing pictures look very weird - definitely does not fit with the colour scheme (or could be just the theme in general), maybe it just because they are currently a bit to big, will rethink this at some point

### The main thing I did manage to achieve: 
- the videos are on the website (see project page)!! Created a random youtube channel, channel name, video name & settings etc. can all be changed. 
- built a rough structure of the website

### A list of things that might be needed:
- something smart to say on the home page (ie here), maybe an introduction of the group?
- project page: some more description for each of the cases might be useful
- publication: would this be required? - happy to do it, shouldn't be too hard, but could just link to google scholar?
- people: picture + short bio?
- logo or whatever that could go on the top left corner & favicon (which is a smiley face currently...)
- stupid question - what is the name of the group? Wall turbulence, I assume from the name of the website? 
- Is there anything else that is needed?

### A list of things that Joy will fix at some point:
- in short all pages looks bad (all suggestions / advice welcomed) - need to rethink the theme / template used
- project page: maybe change background of each button to a relavant picture? not sure if it would look good, but will try
- dropdown menu for project page maybe 
- work out how to wrap text around image
